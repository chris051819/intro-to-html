    William Shakespeare's <em>Sonnets</em>consist of 154 poems, each fourteen line long
    (three <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quatrain">quatrains</a> followed by a rhyming
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Couplet"> couplet</a>).
    <strong>Sonnet 18</strong> is perhaps the most famous, and begins like this:

<blockquote>
    <P>
        Shall I compare thee to a summer's day><br>
        Though art mmore lovely and more temperate.
    </P>
</blockquote>
